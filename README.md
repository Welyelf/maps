# maps

Instruction:
- this repository is in public, so it can be clone
- the current location will only work at a secured site setup
- I only use LeafLet on this test because it's free. But I'm prefer to use Google Maps, I just dont have a paid API Key
- On shareable link, please check the base url, on my end it is (index.php?.....)
- In case you can't setup this on your local, you can still use this link (https://smartbias.us/maps)
- I have used my domain and push it there, just in case there's an issue setting up on your local
